    @param {String} config.name - the name that the module will later be referenced by
    @param {String} [config.type="OAuth2"] - the type of module as determined by the adapter used
    @param {Object} [config.settings={}] - the settings to be passed to the adapter. For specific settings, see the documentation for the adapter you are using.

    @example
    // Create an empty authorizer
    var authz = AeroGear.Authorization();
