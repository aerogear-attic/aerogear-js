/**
    The AeroGear.Auth namespace provides an authentication and enrollment API. Through the use of adapters, this library provides common methods like enroll, login and logout that will just work.
    @status Stable
    @class
    @param {String|Array|Object} [config] - A configuration for the modules(s) being created along with the authenticator. If an object or array containing objects is used, the objects can have the following properties:
    @param {String} config.name - the name that the module will later be referenced by
    @param {String} [config.type="rest"] - the type of module as determined by the adapter used
    @param {Object} [config.settings={}] - the settings to be passed to the adapter. For specific settings, see the documentation for the adapter you are using.
    @returns {Object} The created authenticator containing any auth modules that may have been created
    @example
// Create an empty authenticator
var auth = AeroGear.Auth();

// Create a single module using the default adapter
var auth2 = AeroGear.Auth( "myAuth" );

// Create multiple modules using the default adapter
var auth3 = AeroGear.Auth( [ "someAuth", "anotherAuth" ] );

// Create a single module by passing an object using the default adapter
var auth4 = AeroGear.Auth(
    {
        name: "objectAuth"
    }
);

// Create multiple modules by passing an array of objects using the default adapter
var auth5 = AeroGear.Auth([
    {
        name: "objectAuth"
    },
    {
        name: "objectAuth2",
        settings: { ... }
    }
